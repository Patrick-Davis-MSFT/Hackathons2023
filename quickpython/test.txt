Underlying Medical Conditions and Severe
Illness Among 540,667 Adults Hospitalized
With COVID-19, March 2020–March 2021

Abstract
Introduction
Severe COVID-19 illness in adults has been linked to underlying
medical conditions. This study identified frequent underlying conditions and their attributable risk of severe COVID-19 illness.
Methods
We used data from more than 800 US hospitals in the Premier
Healthcare Database Special COVID-19 Release (PHD-SR) to describe hospitalized patients aged 18 years or older with COVID-19
from March 2020 through March 2021. We used multivariable
generalized linear models to estimate adjusted risk of intensive
care unit admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, and death associated with frequent conditions and total number of conditions.
Results
Among 4,899,447 hospitalized adults in PHD-SR, 540,667
(11.0%) were patients with COVID-19, of whom 94.9% had at
least 1 underlying medical condition. Essential hypertension
(50.4%), disorders of lipid metabolism (49.4%), and obesity
(33.0%) were the most common. The strongest risk factors for
death were obesity (adjusted risk ratio [aRR] = 1.30; 95% CI,
1.27–1.33), anxiety and fear-related disorders (aRR = 1.28; 95%
CI, 1.25–1.31), and diabetes with complication (aRR = 1.26; 95%
CI, 1.24–1.28), as well as the total number of conditions, with
aRRs of death ranging from 1.53 (95% CI, 1.41–1.67) for patients
with 1 condition to 3.82 (95% CI, 3.45–4.23) for patients with
more than 10 conditions (compared with patients with no conditions).

Conclusion
Certain underlying conditions and the number of conditions were
associated with severe COVID-19 illness. Hypertension and disorders of lipid metabolism were the most frequent, whereas
obesity, diabetes with complication, and anxiety disorders were
the strongest risk factors for severe COVID-19 illness. Careful
evaluation and management of underlying conditions among patients with COVID-19 can help stratify risk for severe illness.
Introduction
As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, a need remains to understand indicators for severe illness, defined as admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) or stepdown unit, invasive mechanical
ventilation (IMV), or death (1). Several underlying medical conditions among adults, including diabetes, obesity, chronic kidney
disease (CKD), hypertension, and immunosuppression, have been
reported to be associated with increased risk for severe illness
from COVID-19 (2-4). However, many existing studies are limited in geographic representation, restricted to cases early in the
outbreak, or focused on a limited number of preselected conditions and/or severe outcomes (3–5). Finally, few studies have
shown the effect of the number of underlying medical conditions
on the risk for severe COVID-19 illness (6).
Both the baseline prevalence of a condition and the magnitude of
its association with COVID-19 illness help determine the impact
of a condition at a population level. This study, based on a large
electronic administrative discharge data set, sought to describe the
most frequent underlying medical conditions among hospitalized
patients with COVID-19 and their associations with severe illness.
This information can better inform clinical practice and public
health priorities, such as identifying populations for focused prevention efforts and potential vaccine prioritization.
Methods
We used the Premier Healthcare Database Special COVID-19 Release (PHD-SR, release date May 11, 2021), a large, US hospitalbased, all-payer database (7). The sample included patients aged
18 years or older who had an inpatient encounter with an
International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical
Modification (ICD-10-CM) diagnosis of U07.1 (“COVID-19, virus identified”) from April 1, 2020, through March 31, 2021, or
B97.29 (“other coronavirus as the cause of diseases classified elsewhere,” recommended before the April 2020 release of U07.1)
from March 1, 2020, through April 30, 2020 (8,9).
We examined 3 indicators of severe COVID-19 illness: admission
to an ICU or stepdown unit, IMV, and death. These indicators
were not mutually exclusive.
We considered 2 exposures of interest: 1) specific underlying
medical conditions and 2) the number of conditions. We captured
data on both exposures by using ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes from
inpatient or outpatient hospital records in PHD-SR from January
2019 up to and including a patient’s first inpatient encounter for
COVID-19. We used 1 encounter with an ICD-10-CM code to establish the presence of an underlying condition because few patients had multiple encounters in this hospital database. We excluded 3 ICD-10-CM codes (ie, oxygen support, dependence on a
ventilator, and tracheostomy) listed during the patient’s COVID19 encounter because they could be part of COVID-19 treatment.
We used a multistep approach to identify underlying medical conditions. First, we used the Chronic Condition Indicator (CCI) to
identify chronic ICD-10-CM codes (11,803 of 73,205 total ICD10-CM codes), which were then aggregated into 314 categories
using the Clinical Classifications Software Refined (CCSR)
(10,11). To further differentiate underlying conditions from acute
complications of COVID-19, a panel of physicians (K.K.W.,
W.M.K., H.G.R., B.B., N.T.A., J.M.N.) classified the 314 CCSR
categories into “likely underlying” (274 categories; eg, asthma);
“indeterminate,” which could include underlying or acute complications or both (29 categories; eg, cardiac dysrhythmias); or “likely
acute” (11 categories; eg, acute pulmonary embolism). We used
the “likely underlying” CCSR categories for our analysis of underlying medical conditions and excluded the “indeterminate” or
“likely acute” CCSR categories. People diagnosed with both CCSR categories of “diabetes with complication” and “diabetes
without complication” (n = 55,141) were classified as having diabetes with complication. The number of underlying medical conditions was defined as the number of unique CCSR categories associated with each patient (0, 1, 2–5, 6–10, >10).
Statistical analyses
We described the sample by patient and hospital characteristics.
Then we selected the most frequent underlying CCSR categories
with a prevalence of 10% or more in the sample. We used multivariable generalized linear models with Poisson distribution and
log link function to estimate adjusted risk ratios (aRRs) for 3 outcomes of interest among hospitalized patients: ICU admission,
IMV, and death (reference was surviving hospitalized patients
without that outcome). We performed these estimations by 1) including all frequent CCSR categories in the same model (“full
model”) and 2) including 1 CCSR category per statistical model
(“restricted model”). We focused our interpretations on the CCSR
categories whose direction of association (positive or negative)

was consistent between the restricted and the full model. We also
conducted a stratified analysis of frequent conditions by age group
(frequency ≥10.0% in each age group). Finally, we estimated the
association between the number of CCSR categories and the 3
severity outcomes.
All models used robust SEs clustered on hospital identification,
and controlled for patient age, sex, race/ethnicity, payer type, hospital urbanicity, US Census region of hospital, admission month,
and admission month squared (to account for potential nonlinear
unobservable changes in treatment, patient profile, or severity of
illness during the pandemic). All analyses were conducted using R
version 4.0.2 (The R Foundation) and Stata version 15.1 (StataCorp LLC).
We performed 2 sensitivity analyses using all chronic CCSR categories, including those determined by the clinician panel to be
“likely underlying,” “indeterminate,” and “likely acute.” We performed 1 sensitivity analysis in the main sample and another that
was limited to encounters that preceded the first COVID-19 inpatient encounter. These analyses were used to validate the associations found in the main analysis, as well as to examine the conditions excluded from the main analysis after clinical review.
This activity was reviewed by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) and was conducted according to applicable federal law and CDC policy.
Results
Among 4,899,447 hospitalized patients in PHD-SR, 540,667
(11.0%) patients met the study inclusion criteria for COVID-19
(Table 1). Of patients hospitalized with COVID-19, 94.9% had at
least 1 documented underlying CCSR condition, 249,522 (46.2%)
had an ICU admission, 76,680 (14.2%) received IMV, and 80,174
(14.8%) died. The study sample included 261,078 (48.3%) female
patients, 94,670 (17.5%) non-Hispanic Black patients, and 93,171
(17.2%) Hispanic or Latino patients. The median age was 66
years, and the most common insurance types were Medicare
(292,978 [54.2%]) and commercial (130,995 [24.2%]). The 863
hospitals visited by patients included in the study were distributed
across all US Census regions.
We found 18 underlying CCSR categories with a frequency of
10.0% or more in the sample; the most common were essential hypertension (272,591 [50.4%]), disorders of lipid metabolism
(267,057 [49.4%]; top ICD-10-CM code was hyperlipidemia),
obesity (178,153 [33.0%]), diabetes with complication (171,727
[31.8%]), and coronary atherosclerosis and other heart disease
(134,839 [24.9%]) (Figure 1).

Relative risk of death in the full model was 30% higher with
obesity (95% CI, 27%–33%), 28% higher with anxiety and fearrelated disorders (95% CI, 25%–31%), 26% higher with diabetes
with complication (95% CI, 24%–28%), 21% higher with CKD
(95% CI, 19%–24%), 18% higher with neurocognitive disorders
including dementia and Alzheimer’s disease (95% CI, 15%–21%),
18% higher with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and bronchiectasis (95% CI, 16%–20%), 17% higher with aplastic anemia
including anemia in CKD (95% CI, 14%–19%), 14% higher with
coronary atherosclerosis and other heart disease (95% CI,
12%–16%), and 4% higher with thyroid disorders including hypothyroidism (95% CI, 2%–6%) (Table 2). These conditions were
also associated with a higher risk of IMV and ICU admission.
Diabetes without complication was associated with a 6% lower
risk of death (aRR = 0.94; 95% CI, 0.91–0.97), 9% lower risk of
IMV (aRR = 0.91; 95% CI, 0.88–0.94), and 2% lower risk of ICU
admission (aRR = 0.98; 95% CI, 0.97–0.998). Essential hypertension was associated with an 8% lower risk of death (aRR = 0.92;
95% CI, 0.90–0.93), 6% lower risk of IMV (aRR = 0.94; 95% CI,
0.92–0.95), and a 1% lower risk of ICU admission (aRR = 0.99;
95% CI, 0.97–0.999). Asthma was associated with a 9% lower risk
of death (aRR = 0.91; 95% CI, 0.89–0.94) and a 4% lower risk of
IMV (aRR = 0.96; 95% CI, 0.94–0.99).
Age-stratified analysis showed that the number of frequent underlying medical conditions (present in ≥10.0% of patients) was higher with older age (Table 3). The most frequent conditions were
obesity, diabetes, and essential hypertension among patients
younger than 65, and disorders of lipid metabolism, essential hypertension, diabetes, and coronary atherosclerosis among patients
aged 65 or older. Among patients aged 18 to 39, essential hypertension was associated with a 26% higher risk of death (95% CI,
10%–44%), 25% higher risk of IMV (95% CI, 17%–35%), and an
11% higher risk of ICU admission (95% CI, 7%–15%). In the
same age group, asthma was frequent and was associated with a
9% (95% CI, 5%–13%) higher risk of ICU admission but was not
significantly associated with higher risk of IMV or death. Other
specified status (CCSR category indicating a need for specific
medical support, such as a wheelchair or renal dialysis) was a frequent category among patients aged 40 to 64 and 65 or older and
was associated with a 7% (1%–13%) and 4% (1%–6%) higher risk
of death, respectively.
We found a dose–response association between the total number
of underlying medical conditions and risk of severe COVID-19 illness (Figure 2). Compared with patients with no documented underlying medical conditions, patients’ risk of death was 1.53 times
(95% CI, 1.41–1.67) as high if they had 1 condition, 2.55 times
(95% CI, 2.32–2.80) as high if they had 2 to 5 conditions, 3.29
times (95% CI, 2.98–3.63) as high if they had 6 to 10 conditions,
and 3.82 times (95% CI, 3.45–4.23) as high if they had more than
10 conditions. Adjusted RRs for IMV ranged from 1.57 (95% CI,
1.45–1.70) with 1 condition to 4.47 (95% CI, 4.07–4.90) with
more than 10 conditions. Adjusted risk ratios for ICU admission
ranged from 1.32 (95% CI =1.27–1.36) for patients with 1 condition to 1.96 (95% CI, 1.82–2.11) for patients with more than 10
conditions.

In the first sensitivity analysis, performed by using all CCSR categories, we identified 6 additional frequent “indeterminate” CCSR categories: cardiac dysrhythmias (n = 124,367 [23.0%]), heart
failure (n = 104,858 [19.4%]), other specified nervous system disorders (n = 89,929 [16.6%]; top ICD-10-CM code, metabolic encephalopathy), other specified and unspecified nutritional and
metabolic disorders (n = 89,337 [16.5%]; top code, hypomagnesemia), coagulation and hemorrhagic disorders (n = 75,766
[14.0%]), and diseases of white blood cells (n = 57,765 [10.7%]).
The risk ratio estimates of most previously found underlying conditions were lower with the inclusion of these 6 conditions in the
full models.
In the second sensitivity analysis, which used a subset of 278,215
patients with at least 1 encounter in the PHD-SR before their first
COVID-19 hospitalization, diabetes without complication was associated with an 8% (95% CI, 5%–12%) higher risk of death, a
13% (95% CI, 10%–17%) higher risk of IMV, and a 5% (95% CI,
4%–7%) higher risk of ICU admission; sleep–wake disorders were
associated with an 8% (95% CI, 5%–11%) higher risk of IMV.
Anxiety and fear-related disorders were associated with a 2%
(95% CI, 0.4%–4%) higher risk of ICU admission but not with a
higher risk of death or IMV, on the basis of the full model.

Discussion
Among 4,899,447 hospitalized US adults in the PHD-SR, 540,667
(11.0%) were hospitalized with COVID-19. Among patients hospitalized with COVID-19, we found 18 most frequent underlying
conditions, of which 9 were associated with severe COVID-19 illness. These 9 conditions were both prevalent in the sample (affecting 81.9% of inpatients with COVID-19) and associated with
severe COVID-19 illness, suggesting a high impact at the population level. Essential hypertension and disorders of lipid metabolism were the most frequent conditions, whereas obesity, anxiety
and fear-related disorders, diabetes with complication, and CKD
were the strongest risk factors for death among hospitalized patients with COVID-19. This analysis builds on 2 previous analyses using data from the PHD-SR (3,5), by including more underlying medical conditions in the frequency analysis (274 CCSR categories), including 9 additional months of data, and examining
outcomes other than mortality. The analysis also shows that the
total number of underlying conditions is strongly associated with
severe COVID-19 illness.
The percentage of the US adult population known to have 2 or
more underlying medical conditions ranges from approximately
38% to 64% by state (12). Previous studies demonstrated that patients with medically attended COVID-19 often had multiple underlying medical conditions (6). However, studies have rarely focused on the effect of the number of conditions on severe COVID19 illness. We found that the risk of death, IMV, and ICU admission was often incrementally higher with a higher number of underlying medical conditions. Our finding that the number of underlying medical conditions is itself a risk factor for severe disease from COVID-19 identifies a population that has not been
clearly described in previous literature.
Our results reinforce previous findings of higher risk of severe illness associated with diabetes with complication (13), obesity
(4,14), coronary atherosclerosis and other heart disease (4), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (15), and neurocognitive disorders (3,4). Additionally, we identified several conditions for
which little data exist regarding risk for severe COVID-19 illness,
such as thyroid disorders (including hypothyroidism) and anxiety
and fear-related disorders.
Hypertension and disorders of lipid metabolism (the most prevalent conditions), and obesity and diabetes with complication
(strong risk factors for death, IMV, and ICU admission) are associated with well-described hormonal and inflammatory pathways,
also previously shown to be risk factors for severe COVID-19 illness (16). High baseline prevalence of obesity and diabetes, combined with their association with severe COVID-19 illness, suggest that these 2 conditions could have an outsized impact on the
population with COVID-19. Prevention and treatment of these
conditions may be an important strategy that could improve national resilience against chronic threats and acute crises. Essential
hypertension, for which evidence is mixed on its association with
severe COVID-19 illness (1), was shown in our analysis to be the
most prevalent condition. It was found to be associated with a
higher risk of severe COVID-19 illness only among patients aged
18 to 39 but with a lower risk of severe COVID-19 illness among
older patients and in the full sample. This finding supports a possible link with severe COVID-19 illness and identifies essential
hypertension as a risk factor, especially among younger patients.
Uncomplicated diabetes was found to be negatively associated
with the risk of death and IMV. A positive association with risk of
ICU admission was found only among patients aged 18 to 39. A
previous study showed that although type 2 diabetes was a risk
factor for mortality from severe COVID-19 illness, patients with
diabetes and well-controlled blood glucose had lower mortality
than those with diabetes and poorly controlled blood glucose (13).
Our sensitivity analysis of a subset of patients with pre-COVID
encounters identified a higher relative risk of death associated with
uncomplicated diabetes present before the first COVID hospitalization. Coding bias (uncomplicated diabetes may be less frequently coded in hospitalizations with severe outcomes) (17) or reverse causality (diabetes complications arising from COVID-19
illness or treatment) (18) could explain this finding.
Anxiety and fear-related disorders were a prevalent condition in
our sample; they were also the second highest risk factor for death
among the underlying conditions considered in our study. The
reasons for this finding are likely multifactorial and may include a
reduced ability to prevent infection among patients with anxiety
disorders, the immunomodulatory and/or cardiovascular effects of
medications used to treat these disorders, or severe COVID-19 illness exacerbating anxiety disorders (19,20). In a subset of patients with pre-COVID encounters in our study, anxiety diagnosed before COVID-19 was not independently associated with
death or IMV during COVID-19 hospitalization and, therefore, it
is also plausible that anxiety was diagnosed during COVID-19 illness and may be a resulting sequela of COVID-19 (21). Future
studies could explore the temporal and causal associations
between anxiety disorders and severe COVID-19 illness.
Our finding of a positive association of CKD and coronary atherosclerosis and other heart disease with severe COVID-19 illness has
been well described at the epidemiologic level (22). We also found
that people with neurocognitive disorders (including dementia and
Alzheimer’s disease) were at a higher risk of severe COVID-19
illness, which could be associated with difficulties in access to
care and difficulties in following safeguarding procedures (23).

Our finding of an association of anemia (specifically, anemia in
CKD) with severe COVID-19 illness may be driven by a reduced
capacity to respond to acute infections in people with this condition (24).
Asthma diagnosis was present among 10.5% of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in PHD-SR, which is higher than the 8.0%
national prevalence of asthma in 2019 (25). At the same time, we
found asthma to be associated with a lower risk of death in the full
sample; a positive association with ICU admission was found only
among patients younger than 40. This finding supports the mixed
evidence on asthma as a risk factor for severe COVID-19 illness
(1), although the association between asthma and severe COVID19 illness could differ by the degree of asthma severity (26).
A sensitivity analysis revealed 6 “indeterminate” conditions (such
as coagulation and hemorrhagic disorders, cardiac dysrhythmias,
and heart failure) that were both frequent and associated with at
least 1 severe COVID-19 illness outcome. Without better information on the temporality of these 6 conditions relative to the
COVID-19 illness, we were unable to determine whether these
were truly underlying conditions (27,28). Our second sensitivity
analysis, restricted to 278,215 patients with encounters that preceded the first COVID-19 encounter, found a positive association
of sleep–wake disorders and uncomplicated diabetes with severe
COVID-19 illness. Weaker associations of other frequent conditions with COVID-19 illness in this analysis (compared with the
main results) could be due to under-ascertainment of certain conditions that resulted from using data only for pre-COVID encounters.
Our study has limitations. First, using ICD-10-CM diagnostic
codes to identify COVID-19 cases might result in misclassification, although COVID-19 codes in PHD-SR showed high sensitivity and specificity with SARS-CoV-2 test results (29). Second,
ICU risk estimates could be biased if ICU admission reflected
factors other than severity of COVID-19, such as anticipation of
future severity among health care professionals. Third, because
our data were observational, we could not establish causal associations between the underlying conditions and severe COVID-19
illness. Fourth, relying on ICD-10-CM codes to identify underlying medical conditions may have underestimated their prevalence.
For example, obesity was diagnosed in 33.0% of the patients,
which is possibly an underestimate of this condition, given the national prevalence of 42.4% in 2017–2018 (30) and the prevalence
of 50.8% among patients with available height and weight data in
PHD-SR (14). Fifth, prior literature shows evidence of both increased documentation (31) and underdiagnosis of certain chronic
conditions among patients with more severe illness (17). Sixth, the
interrelation of the conditions made it difficult to obtain independent associations, which could explain why certain conditions (disorders of lipid metabolism, sleep–wake disorders, esophageal disorders, and depressive disorders) had a positive association with
COVID-19 illness when not adjusted for other conditions and a
negative association when adjusted for other conditions. These differences could be explained by 1) confounding in the restricted
model, 2) lack of independent effects in the full model, or 3) potential overadjustment in the full model by including variables that
were on the causal pathway between the condition of interest and
the outcome. Seventh, we were unable to assess the associations of
current treatment modalities or medications for underlying medical conditions and severe COVID-19 illness because that information was not available in detail. Finally, including only the most
frequent underlying medical conditions in the estimations of risk
could have caused us to miss less prevalent risk factors of severity;
however, conditions of any frequency were accounted for in the
“number of conditions” predictor.
Our study found that 9 of 18 frequent underlying medical conditions among adults hospitalized with COVID-19 were associated
with severe illness. Combined with the high prevalence of these
conditions (affecting 81.9% of hospitalized patients with COVID19 in PHD-SR), this finding suggests a potentially high impact at
the population level. The highest risk of severe COVID-19 illness
was associated with obesity, anxiety and fear-related disorders,
diabetes with complication, CKD, and neurocognitive disorders.
Among patients younger than 40, essential hypertension was also
a risk factor for death. The total number of underlying medical
conditions was a strong risk factor of severe COVID-19 illness.
Preventing COVID-19 in populations with these conditions and
multiple conditions should remain a public health priority, along
with targeted mitigation efforts and ensuring high uptake of vaccine, when available, in these people and their close contacts
